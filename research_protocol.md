# Research Protocol

This document describes the research protocol used for conducting the literature study on policy-driven code generation for microservice-based data-sharing systems. It includes the search strategy, selection process, data extraction, and synthesis approach to ensure the study's transparency and replicability.

## 1. Study Objective

The goal of this study is to systematically investigate how high-level policy specifications can be transformed into executable microservice components, with the aim of supporting policy-driven system design and providing actionable guidance for developers. The study focuses on:

- Policy modeling languages
- Data-sharing architectures
- Code generation techniques (especially template-based code generation)

## 2. Databases Used

The following academic databases were used to conduct the search:

- IEEE Xplore
- ACM Digital Library
- SpringerLink
- Google Scholar

## 3. Search Period

January 2013 – March 2025

## 4. Search Keywords

The search was performed using combinations of the following keywords:


- "normative specification syntax"
- policy enforcement "normative specification"
- "policy enforcement"
- "policy-to-code transformation"
- "code generation"
- "model-driven engineering"
- "microservice architecture"
- "data sharing architecture"
- “medical data sharing”
- "healthcare data sharing"
- "eFLINT"
- "DPCL"
- "XACML"

### Example Search String:
("policy modeling" OR "policy expression" OR "policy specification") AND
("code generation" OR "policy-to-code" OR "template-based generation") AND
("microservices" OR "data sharing" OR "model-driven engineering")

## 5. Inclusion Criteria

- I1: Studies focusing on policy modeling languages or policy specification mechanisms.
- I2: Studies addressing data-sharing systems or microservice-based architectures.
- I3: Studies proposing automated model-to-code generation methods.
- I4: Studies published as peer-reviewed journal or conference papers.

## 6. Exclusion Criteria

- E1: Duplicate publications or early-stage versions of already included studies.
- E2: Studies focusing solely on technical system implementation without addressing high-level policy modeling or specification aspects.
- E3: Studies unrelated to microservice architecture or model-driven engineering (MDE)-oriented code generation.

## 7. Study Selection Process

- Step 1: Apply search strings to the selected databases.
- Step 2: Screen titles and abstracts for relevance.
- Step 3: Apply inclusion and exclusion criteria to full-text papers.
- Step 4: Apply snowballing (both backward and forward) to identify additional relevant studies.
- Step 5: Finalize the list of primary studies for data extraction.

## 8. Snowballing Sources

Additional studies were identified through snowballing from key references, including:

- Model-Driven Code Generation for Microservices: Service Models
- van Binsbergen et al.: eFLINT: A Domain-Specific Language for Executable Norm Specifications

## 9. Data Extraction Attributes

For each selected study, the following information was extracted:

- Bibliographic information (authors, title, year, venue)
- Policy language or framework discussed
- System architecture type
- Code generation approach
- Key contributions
- Identified limitations and open challenges

## 10. Data Synthesis Approach

The extracted data were analyzed through qualitative comparison, grouped across three thematic areas:

- Policy modeling languages
- Enforcement architectures
- Code generation techniques

Key design patterns, limitations, and trade-offs were identified during synthesis to inform the research discussion.
