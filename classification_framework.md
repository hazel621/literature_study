# Classification Framework

This document describes the classification framework used for data synthesis during the literature review. Each selected primary study was analyzed based on the following parameters:

## 1. Policy Modeling Characteristics

- **Policy Language**: The language or framework used for policy modeling (e.g., DPCL, eFLINT, ODRL, XACML).
- **Normative Foundation**: Whether the language is grounded in normative concepts such as Hohfeld's legal theory or deontic logic.
- **Executability**: Whether the policy model can be directly executed or interpreted.

## 2. Enforcement Architecture

- **Architecture Type**: Centralized, distributed, or microservice-based.
- **Enforcement Mechanism**: Static vs. dynamic enforcement; ex-ante vs. ex-post mechanisms.
- **Integration Approach**: Integration via normative actors, PDP/PEP models, or event-driven systems.

## 3. Code Generation Approach

- **Generation Technique**: Model-to-text transformation, template-based code generation (TBCG), or manual code integration.
- **Level of Automation**: Fully automated, semi-automated, or manual.
- **Target Language/Platform**: Languages or platforms targeted for code generation (e.g., Java, Jolie, Solidity, RESTful APIs).

## 4. Application Domain

- **Domain**: Healthcare, data sharing, privacy management, legal reasoning, access control, etc.
- **Regulatory Context**: Whether the approach addresses specific regulations (e.g., GDPR).

## 5. Contribution Type

- **Type**: Language proposal, tool implementation, framework design, empirical evaluation, or theoretical analysis.
- **Key Contributions**: Summary of the main technical contributions made by the study.

## 6. Identified Limitations

- **Limitations**: Any known or reported limitations in terms of scalability, expressiveness, generalizability, or maintainability.
